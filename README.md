# Description
The Pico Music Controller is a project that turns a Raspberry Pi Pico (not W!) into a USB device for controlling Spotify. The Pico communicates with a desktop app to make calls to the Spotify Web API.

I created this project to address some annoyances I had while using Spotify. I always use Spotify while programming, and sometimes I want to pause/play, change the song, or adjust the volume. Usually, this requires opening the Spotify app. Although my keyboard has media buttons that reduce the need to open the app, the volume button affects the entire system sound rather than just Spotify. Additionally, if I have a video playing in the background, the buttons can control that instead of Spotify. This project solves those issues and helps boost productivity.
